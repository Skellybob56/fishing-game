I plan on using jsonc to store the human readable map format. The idea is based on the map format from the original Quake. In the future, I may need to also create a denser, easier to parse format for reading speed during gameplay but just using the jsonc format is okay if it is not too slow and may improve the speed of prototyping.
The format is also very flexible to include various `classname`s for future extensibility.
I have converted the heightmap from the art sandbox into the map file structure by hand but in the future I wish to create an editor.
The extension is currently `.fgmap` though this is subject to change as the project gets a name better than 'fishing game' and if I need to create another format for the compiled maps.
I have also created a small python script (`/maps/map_testing_renderer.py`) that helped me check if I reproduced the map correctly.
